## 1. Kadane's Algorithm.
### Largest Sum Contiguous SubArray.
#### Input : n = 8 <br> A[] = -2 -3 4 -1 -2 1 5 -3
#### Output : 7

## 2.Leaders in an array.
### Given an array A of positive integers. Your task is to find the leaders in the array. An element of array is leader if it is greater than or equal to all the elements to its right side. The rightmost element is always a leader. 
#### Input : n = 6 <br> A[] = {16,17,4,3,5,2}
#### Output : 17 5 2

## 3.Missing number in array.
### Given an array of size n-1 such that it only contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to n. Find the missing element.
#### Input : n = 10 <br> A[] = {6,1,2,8,3,4,7,10,5}
#### Output : 9

## 4.Minimize the sum of product.
### You are given two arrays, A and B, of equal size N. The task is to find the minimum value of A[0]*B[0]+A[1]*B[1]+....+A[N-1]*B[N-1], where shuffling of elements of arrays A and B is allowed.
#### Input : n = 5 <br> A[] = {6,1,9,5,4} , B[] = {3,4,8,2,4}
#### Output : 80

## 5.Kth smallest element.
### Given an array arr[] and an integer k where k is smaller than size of array, the task is to find the Kth smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.
#### Input : n = 5 <br> A[] = {7,10,4,20,15} <br> k = 4
#### Output : 15

## 6.Add Binary Strings
### Given two binary strings A and B consisting of only 0s and 1s. Find the resultant string after adding the two Binary Strings.
Note: The input strings may contain leading zeros but the output string should not have any leading zeros.
#### Input : A = "1101", B = "111"
#### Output : 10100
